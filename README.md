  Personal Portfolio
</h1>

Hello and welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio! </br>
Check out the portfolio here: [https://Heytherejoakim.com](https://heytherejoakim.com/)

## Description

This portfolio functions as a homepage for people interested in my work. </br>
This portfolio contains:

- professional & personal information about me
- showcase past and current projects
- contact information

### Tech Stack

- Next.JS
- React 
- SASS
- Deployed on Vercel

### Carousel & Map

The carousel showing my past and current prooject are made using the React framework <b> react-multi-carousel</b>.

The contact section contains an interactive Map. I modified and designed it to my liking on their website, then fetched my own version with an API call from <b>mapbox-gl</b>

### Roadmap

This is the first iteration for this project and any feedback or comment for improvement is highly appreciated.

The next step for this project is to connect it to a CMS-system. This will make it easily maintainable and scalable. I also plan to include a section for Graphic Designs, and a blogsection. 

## Make it on your own! 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
